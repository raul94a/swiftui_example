# Example of SwiftUI

Just a simple project for playing with SwiftUI.

* Use a json file to store data.
* Use the Decodable and Hashable user to be used as a model for pasing the json to a list of Users.
* Use the list of users to render a list of components.
* Navigate to the details of each component by tapping on the item row.
